imported pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to handle data and make plots.
read the CSV to get my data into Python.
used histograms to see how values are distributed in each column.
used a boxplot to check for outliers in the first column.
used a scatter plot to see the relationship between the first and second columns.
calculated a correlation matrix to measure how strongly columns are related.
used a heatmap to visualize those correlations easily.
